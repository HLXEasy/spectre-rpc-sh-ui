# Load the given language file and set all keys with their values as variables
# $1: Short lang name i. e. "en" or "de"
#
# 1. Yaml syntax because translations are generated with https://transifex.com/
# 2. Comments must start with "#" as the first character on the line
# 3. Syntax line by line like this example (without the ' of course):
#    'TEXT_PW_EXPL: "Enter wallet password"'
# 4. Character '@' is replaced by backslash during evaluation of strings, so
#    each '@Z' will be '\Z' afterwards
# 5. Interpret embedded "\Z" sequences in the dialog text by the following character,
#    which tells dialog to set colors or video attributes: 0 through 7 are the ANSI
#    used in curses: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan and white respectively.
#    Bold is set by 'b', reset by 'B'.
#    Reverse is set by 'r', reset by 'R'.
#    Underline is set by 'u', reset by 'U'.
#    The settings are cumulative,
#    e.g., "\Zb\Z1" makes the following text bold (perhaps bright) red.
#    Restore normal settings with "\Zn".
